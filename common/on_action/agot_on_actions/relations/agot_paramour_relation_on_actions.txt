#On actions relating to relationships between characters

####################################
# NOTE
####################################
# All relations have these autogenerated, even if they're not explicitly written out here.
# The full list is:
# [relation]_quarterly_pulse
# on_set_relation_[relation]
# on_remove_relation_[relation]
# on_death_relation_[relation]
#
# The following two on_actions are scripted, rather than being called by code, so if you want one for them then it must be created and fired from the quarterly pulse.
# [relation]_status_changes
# [relation]_relation_changes

#According to PDX doc, ROOT is the DYING character, scope:target is the squire
