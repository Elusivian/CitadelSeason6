KENNING_LEGACY_OF_HERROCK_KENNING:0 "House Kenning of Kayce was founded in a peculiar way. The house was first born when [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('KenningK_4').GetFirstName] Kenning, an ironborn warrior from the island of [GetTitleByKey('d_harlaw').GetNameNoTier], took the town of Kayce not for the kings of salt and sea, but for the King of the Rock.

KENNING_BRUTAL_HISTORY:0 "Like all ironborn, House Kenning of Kayce's lineage have partaken in many particularly brutal excursions, serving in many raids.

For this reason, House Kenning has developed a unique aptitude for raiding amongst its Westerman allies.\n#weak Some Kennings tend to become [GetTrait('wrathful').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
KENNING_LOYAL_TO_THE_ROCK:0 "After forsaking their previous Ironborn overlords, House Kenning of Kayce has been wholly loyal to the kings, and now lords, of [GetTitleByKey('c_casterly_rock').GetNameNoTier], and no Kenning has yet forsaken these new vows.\n#weak Some Kennings tend to become [GetTrait('loyal').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
KENNING_BLOOD_OF_BLACK_AND_GOLD_ALIKE:0 "A unique mixture of Ironborn brutality and Westerman acumen, the members of House Kenning of Kayce are truly unique among the other Westerosi mainlanders, and as such, they benefit from the best of both cultures."

The ancient manuscripts in the Citadel claim that just a drop of Blood Iron added during the forging process was enough to turn an entire sword red.\n  Either way, we have a unique oppurtunity. With this metal, we could forge a great Lion Throne made of steel. While it could not be made completely of Valyrian Steel, of course, we could afford to purchase a small Valyrian Steel trinket for 500 gold and melt it down to be included in the forging process.\n  Such a throne would speak to the majesty of House Reynes. And forging it with the Valyrian steel pattern would give it the idential look of [red_artifact.GetName], the Crimson Valyrian Blade held in the Iron Islands. No one knows of any process to produce Red Steel other than with Blood Iron, and no one would question your claim to the Valyrian blade once the Throne is complete."
