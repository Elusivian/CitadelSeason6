fashion_weirdwood_bow_decision_desc: "The wood of the weirwood is an excellent, though expensive, building material because it does not rot. Weirwood can be used for making bows, spears, and arrows. Unfortunately, our own [GetBuilding('agot_raventree_hall_01').GetName] is as the name suggests, very much dead and not very useful for bowmaking.\n\nIf I am to fashion a Weirwood Bow, like my distant relation through [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Blackwood_81').GetFullName], [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Targaryen_96').GetCharacterViewNameNicknamed] once did, I would need to send someone further afield to search for suitable weirwood.\n\nPerhaps to [GetGeographicalRegion('world_westeros_the_north').GetName], or maybe even [GetGeographicalRegion('world_westeros_beyond_the_wall').GetName].\n\n#weak Fund a bowyer and explorer to search for suitable weirwood for bowmaking."
