The master smith [smith.GetFirstName] approaches, he carries with him the designs for his new creation: the Flayed Man Armour.\n\n'My lord,' [smith.GetFirstName] says, presenting the detailed sketches.\n'We are prepared to begin the forging of your armour. The plates will be dark red, crafted to resemble the flayed skin of your enemies, a fitting tribute to your house’s legacy.'\n\nExamining the design, your gaze intensifies. 'It is not just armour,' you state, your voice echoing off the walls, 'it is a declaration. Let all who look upon it know fear.'\n\nNodding with a grim satisfaction, the smith replies, 'It will be as you command, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. The forges will burn day and night until your armour is shaped to perfection.'"

Today, the forges have grown silent; their task completed. In the armory, [smith.GetFirstName] stands ready, the newly forged Flayed Man Armour laid out before him, a terrifying masterpiece of dark red steel fashioned to evoke the horrors of flayed flesh.\n\n'My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]', he begins, his voice steady, 'the armour you commissioned is complete.' He gestures towards the suit, each piece artfully crafted to intertwine dread with protection. 'Its plates have been designed to mirror the flayed skin of your enemies.' The intricate patterns run like rivers of blood across the armour.\n\n'It is not merely armour', you murmur, a cold smile playing upon your lips. 'It is a declaration of our power.'\n\n[smith.GetFirstName] bows, his task complete, leaving you wearing the armour as a second skin.

make_flayed_man_armor_0003_a_desc: "Your heavy steps echo through the deserted armory of [GetTitleByKey('b_the_dreadfort').GetNameNoTier], your arrival marked by a cold, brooding silence. Before you on the workbench lies the unfinished Flayed Man Armour; its dark red steel is rough and unpolished, the sinuous patterns meant to evoke terror are instead crude, botched attempts by a faltering hand.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the armour's chest piece is warped, the greaves are mismatched, and the entire set bears the marks of hurried, fearful craftsmanship. It is clear [smith.GetFirstName] has fled, overwhelmed by the [dread|E] of his task and the consequences of failure.\n\nWith a scornful grimace, you contemplates the abandoned armour, a project undone by the very terror it was meant to embody.\n\n[smith.GetFirstName] will be found, and the price of fear will be exacted in flesh."
