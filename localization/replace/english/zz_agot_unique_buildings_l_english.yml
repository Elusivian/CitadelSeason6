The ancient manuscripts in the Citadel claim that just a drop of Blood Iron added during the forging process was enough to turn an entire sword red.\n  Either way, we have a unique oppurtunity. With this metal, we could forge a great Lion Throne made of steel. While it could not be made completely of Valyrian Steel, of course, we could afford to purchase a small Valyrian Steel trinket for 500 gold and melt it down to be included in the forging process.\n  Such a throne would speak to the majesty of House Reynes. And forging it with the Valyrian steel pattern would give it the idential look of [red_artifact.GetName], the Crimson Valyrian Blade held in the Iron Islands. No one knows of any process to produce Red Steel other than with Blood Iron, and no one would question your claim to the Valyrian blade once the Throne is complete."
