fashion_crossbow_decision_desc: "House [GetDynastyByID('dynn_Drox').GetName] was formed by the union of First Men and Andal nobles during the coming of the Andals. Other noble houses formed around the same time strut around with their Valyrian steel swords, while we have no such ancestral heirloom to call our own.\nOur sigil consists of three crossbows, and if we were to have an ancestral heirloom, it should be just that; a crossbow.\n\nI'm going to build my own heirloom, with ebonwood and belt hooks! If I am to fashion a crossbow of worthy quality, I would need to send someone further afield to search for suitable exotic wood.\n\nPerhaps to [GetGeographicalRegion('world_essos').GetName], or maybe even beyond.\n\n#weak Fund an explorer to search for suitable wood for engineering an heirloom crossbow."

fashion_crossbow_0001_c_desc: "There are few problems that gold cannot solve, with enough money and daring adventureres, enough suitable exotic wood for crafting a crossbow could be recovered.\n\n[bowyer.GetFirstName], a local adventurer has offered to lead the expedition to [GetGeographicalRegion('world_essos').GetName] to search for the exotic wood.\n\nThe expedition will be both expensive and dangerous, but the rewards could be impressive."

He bows and presents it to me.\n\n"A true engineering marvel, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. We found ample amounts of exotic wood in the jungles of the [GetTitleByKey('k_disputed_lands').GetNameNoTier], and on our return journey [GetTitleByKey('c_myr').GetHolder.GetName] was kind enough to let me use the workshops and engineering expertise found in the [GetTitleByKey('b_southern_market').GetNameNoTier]. All the best crossbows have names, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. Will you name it?"\n\nI take the crossbow into my hands, and ponder for a second, while I take aim.
