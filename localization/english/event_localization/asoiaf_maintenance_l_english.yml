 asoiaf_maintenance_events_0001_a_desc:0 "Years of relentless pursuit carved away the person I once was. Each town, each fleeting moment of safety, only serves to remind me of the assassins one step behind. Begging for shelter from this noble or that... And through it all, the crushing weight of being the last hope of a dynasty — the greatest dynasty this world has ever seen — resting on my shoulder since I was seven years old.\n\n[asoiaf_Targaryen_9.GetFirstName], oblivious to our constant peril, has lived under my protection. I've shielded her from the reality of our life: one where death is but a breath away and trust is a luxury we can't afford. I've been her brother, father, teacher, and shield.\n\nBut years in exile have taken their toll. The tender part of me is gone, replaced by a resolve as hard as Valyrian steel. Kindness is a weakness I can no longer afford. To keep my sister safe and our dynasty alive, I must become a weapon — cold, ruthless, and unyielding."

She was my last tether to the past, my reason to endure the hardship. Without her, the darkness feels even more suffocating, and the path forward more ruthless. I am truly alone.\n\nYears in exile have taken their toll. The tender part of me is gone, replaced by a resolve as hard as Valyrian steel. Kindness is a weakness I can no longer afford.

 asoiaf_maintenance_events_0002_a_desc:0 "Months of navigating the world as a married woman have forged a new strength within me. No longer am I the timid girl under my brother's shadow. My union with [asoiaf_Targaryen_9_spouse.GetFirstName] awaked a power I never knew I possessed — a power to command, lead, and inspire.\n\nThe whispers of doubt that once plagued me are gone. I am no longer just the sister of [asoiaf_Targaryen_8.GetShortUIName]. I am Daenerys Stormborn, capable of ruling in my own right and forged in the crucible of fire and blood. With every decision, every step, I feel the weight of my brother's shadow lifting, replaced by my own unyielding resolve.\n\nMy path ahead is clear. I will not be the pawn in another's game. I am the Blood of Old Valyria, the harbinger of a new age, and I will shape my destiny with relentless determination. Fire now flows through my veins, as unbreakable as a dragon's scales."

 asoiaf_maintenance_events_0003_desc:0 "Seeing [asoiaf_Targaryen_9.GetFirstName] thrive without me is a dagger to the heart. She was always my responsibility, my sister, my charge. Now, she stands strong, no longer needing the protection I once offered. Each day she grows more confident, more powerful, and I'm left in the shadows watching as she outgrows the care I struggled to provide.\n\nHer strength, her resolve — they should fill me with pride, yet all I feel is a gnawing sense of loss. The very thing I fought for, her safety, now leaves me feeling adrift and purposeless.\n\nThe whispers questioning my worth grow louder each day. I am #italic Viserys Targaryen#!, yet my sister's rising star eclipses my own. She's become the embodiment of our family's legacy, while I grapple with the remnants of what once defined me. I must find a new path, or risk being consumed by the shadows she leaves behind."

 asoiaf_maintenance_events_0004_desc:0 "Months of marriage have revealed a transformation in [asoiaf_Targaryen_9.GetFirstName]. She's emerged from the shadow of her past, shedding any lingering fears and insecurities. Her once tentative steps are now sure and deliberate, each decision reflecting her growing strength and determination.\n\nShe carries herself with an air of confidence that commands respect and admiration. The timid girl is gone, replaced by a woman who knows her worth and the power she holds. Her eyes, once searching for approval, now blaze with resolve. This is not the same Daenerys I married; she's become something more.\n\nThere is a quiet pride in witnessing her ascend to this newfound strength. While I stand by her side, I know that her destiny is hers to shape, with or without my guidance."

 asoiaf_maintenance_events_0005_desc:0 "Days later I still brood over reports of how the traitor, Lord [asoiaf_Baratheon_2.GetFirstName], slew my son and heir [asoiaf_Targaryen_3.GetFirstName] in battle. Doubtless the trecherous Martells were involved, perhaps even my very own Kingsguard Ser [asoiaf_Martell_2.GetFirstName]. I will ensure their doom comes in kind, with fire and blood...\n\nRight now the realm needs an heir more than ever, but should that heir truly be Prince [asoiaf_Targaryen_11.GetFirstName]? Every law of succession would say so, but the boy is too young to serve the realm when it needs him most. And he is half-Martell to boot... half traitor already.\n\nOthers may have forgotten how my son plotted against me these last years, conspiring to depose me or worse. But I never forget, nor do I forgive. Can I trust that his spawn will not stab me in the back when I least expect it?"

Whispers stir among the lords of the realm that a son must always come before a daughter.\n\nThe realm's contempt for me is palpable — their lack of faith in a woman's right to rule. They fear what it means for their own positions and that of their sons, and already the drums of war begin to sound...\n\nI have but one choice to secure my claim, yet I hesitate to give the order. My brothers' only crime was being born, but they stand in the way of my destiny. #bold Can I truly do what must be done?#!"

My reign, that of my children, and our very lives, will only be secure if this deed is done.\n\nIt's a difficult thing seeing them in front of me, their tired, worn faces filled with a mix of fear and hatred. But I owe them the courtesy of meeting their eyes when I give the order.\n\nEven now, [asoiaf_alicent.GetFirstName] begs for her children's lives, making all manner of hollow promises about my right to rule.

Shortly after her ascent to the Iron Throne, Queen [asoiaf_rhaenyra.GetFirstName] shocked the realm by imprisoning and summarily executing her brothers.\n\nAlready the word "tyranny" isn't far from many people's lips, yet it cannot be denied that all whispers of usurpation have come to an abrupt end. Doubtless many would-be kingmakers across the realm now curse their fortunes, finding themselves lacking a rightful king to crown.\n\nThis blood-soaked gambit may have secured [asoiaf_rhaenyra.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] her throne, but will she be able to keep it?"
