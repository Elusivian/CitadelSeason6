BANEFORT_BLACK_DUNGEONS_OF_THE_FORT:0 "It is said that in the deepest dungeons of the Banefort, the Hooded kings of old practiced powerful necromantic spells to raise the dead and use them as soldiers. Whether those rumours are true, or the dungeons are merely torture chambers; it is known only to the lords of the Banefort.\n#weak Some Baneforts tend to become [GetTrait('sadistic').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
BANEFORT_WELCOME_THE_GUESTS:0 "Despite their ominous appearance, House Banefort's words are 'Welcome Stranger'.

BANEFORT_MARCHERS_OF_IRONMAN_BAY:0 "House Banefort have fought off Ironborn reavers for centuries. While they possess no impressive naval presence, the Baneforts have thrown the Ironborn back to the sea many times. Many Ironborn have also found themselves unfortunate enough to land in the Banefort dungeons."
BANEFORT_SHADOW_KINGS_ONCE_MORE:0 "We have overthrown our petty overlords and now, under our hood, the realm is covered in prosperous shadow. Kings once more, both terrible and glorious. All who live beneath us shall serve loyally, or be consumed by the man beneath the hood."

CARGYLL_KNIGHTS_OF_HONOR_AND_DUTY:0 "House Cargyll has produced many exemplary knights and warriors. Though their lands are small, their prowess is revered and their loyalty is well-known.

FREY_FAMILY_MATTERS:0 "House Frey is an incredibly young house by Riverlander standards, especially amongst those of the Green Fork. Their explosive rise to prominence is largely due to their immense familial cooperation, making use of the combined brainpower and manpower of their entire dynasty. This reputation has become synonymous with notions of fertility.\n#weak Some Freys tend to become [GetTrait('fecund').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]"
FREY_SO_CALLED_UPSTARTS:0 "House Frey's relevantly recent rise to such lordly stature has made them very unpopular amongst the Westerosi highborn.

FREY_TRIDENT_TOLL_COLLECTORS:0 "House Frey hails from the keep of [GetTitleByKey('c_arganbrook').GetNameNoTier], a fortified seat situated on the western bank of the Green Fork. Their newest seat, known colloquially as [GetTitleByKey('c_the_twins').GetNameNoTier], occupies as an incredibly strategic position as a major crossing across the Trident. From this position, House Frey exacts toll on any and all that would seek to use their fortified bridge, and as such they have become incredibly wealthy and opulent, surpassing even the Tullys of Riverrun.\n#weak Some Freys tend to become [GetTrait('greedy').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]. "
FREY_CRANNOGMAN_RIVALRY:0 "House Frey's deep hatred for their Crannogman neighbours to the north is well-documented. Often referring to them as 'frog-eaters' or 'mud-men', the hatred has become instiutionalised among the Frey coterie. For this reason, the majority of House Frey's martial endeavours are centered around this anti-Crannogman dogma."
FREY_PLANS_OF_OUR_OWN:0 "House Frey has risen to such stature that they have far surpassed the wealth of and claim dominion over larger lands than their liege lords. The house can marshal more men than almost any other house in the Riverlands, surpassed only by the Mallisters of Seagard to the west.

strong_legacy_5_name: "Power Among the Rivers"

STRONG_EPONYMOUS_PHYSIQUES:0 "House Strong is an old and storied house of the Riverlands, often boasting of their First Men descent. This First Men blood runs thick through their veins, and has blessed many a Strong lord with a robust and powerful physique. Ser [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Strong_30').GetFirstName] Strong was often regarded as the most physically imposing and strongest knight in the Seven Kingdoms, and this reputation precedes and succeeds even him.\n#weak Some Strongs tend to become [GetTrait('strong').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] or [GetTrait('physique_good_2').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
STRONG_A_HOUSE_OF_HANDS:0 "House Strong has a legacy of proud and loyal servitude to the Crown, and many of its members have had the honour of serving as Hand of the King. The most legendary example was Lord [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Strong_7').GetFirstName] Strong, the Hand to King [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Targaryen_27').GetFirstName] I, 'the Conqueror'. Lord-Hand Osmund was the man responsible for the construction of the walls around King's Landing, and surely many more Strong lords are destined to continue his legacy of loyal and diligent servitude.\n#weak Some Strongs tend to become [GetTrait('loyal').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] or [GetTrait('diligent').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."
STRONG_STEWARDS_OF_HARRENHAL:0 "To many, receiving the Lordship of Harrenhal is as good as a death sentence. House Strong, however, has so far shirked this superstition, and has continued to further their position from their new seat at Harrenhal. As high lords of both the lordship of [GetTitleByKey('d_harrenhal').GetNameNoTier] and the [GetTitleByKey('d_three_forks').GetNameNoTier], House Strong maintains a position as the most powerful bannerman to House Tully. This position does not come without its drawbacks, however. Harrenhal is still in disrepair, even with the reconstruction efforts of its various lords, and repair projects are incredibly costly, both in gold and sanity."
STRONG_EAR_OF_THE_CROWN:0 "Due to their regional power and their reputation as loyal and competent servants, House Strong often finds itself in very good graces with the monarchs of King's Landing. In recent times, it has become a very rare sight to see a Small Council named without a sitting Lord Strong, and an even rarer sight to find a king without a Strong advisor somewhere amongst his court. For this reason, it is very simple for the lords of Harrenhal to influence realm politics, and even easier to manipulate the decisionmaking of the presiding kings and queens."
STRONG_POWER_AMONG_THE_RIVERS:0 "Due to their huge domains and densely-populated lands, House Strong is able to marshal an incredibly large army, and posture it among the sprawling grounds of Harrenhal."

GRACEFORD_GREAT_SEPTS_OF_HOLYHALL:0 "House Graceford are the builders and keepers of the Great Sept at Holyhall, one of the largest septs in the Seven Kingdoms. The sept is a frequent target for pilgrimages, and many lords, clergymen and travellers pay patronage to its marble walls."
GRACEFORD_LORDS_OF_PEACE_AND_PROSPERITY:0 "House Graceford is not a martial nor subversive house, and yet the house remains strong, navigating skilfully through many troubled times.

MALLISTER_DEFENDERS_OF_SEAGARD:0 "House Mallister rules over the significant walled city of [GetTitleByKey('c_seagard').GetNameNoTier], the third largest city in the Riverlands, behind Fairmarket and Maidenpool.

OAKHEART_SIRED_ON_GIANTESSES:0 "The founder of House Oakheart, the mythical John the Oak, was said to be sired on a Giantess of the Reach by Garth Greenhand.

OAKHEART_GARDENER_MARSHALS:0 "House Oakheart has a storied history of martial mastery. Under the Gardener Kings, the position of Grand Marshal was oftentimes occupied by an Oakheart lord, even until the very end, when the Oakhearts led the left flank during the fateful Field of Fire."
OAKHEART_UNYIELDING_AS_THE_OAK:0 "Members of House Oakheart are commonly compared to the old oaks from which they hail, often described as stubborn, unwavering, or dogmatic.

PEAKE_LEGACY_OF_FLORYS_THE_FOX:0 "Like Houses Florent and Ball, House Peake's founder is said to be descended from one of the husbands of the legendary Florys the Fox, the conniving and shrewd daughter of Garth Greenhand.

PEAKE_VICTORS_OF_THE_ANCIENT_RIVALRY:0 "The dynastic feud between House Peake and House Manderly is the most famous and well-documented among any in the Seven Kingdoms, including those of the Marcher lords of the Red Mountains.

CONNINGTON_GRIFFIN_TO_WIN_IT:0 "House Connington under the Targaryen regime was an incredibly powerful house, marshalling the most men in the Stormlands and accruing wealth comparable even to House Tarth.

CONNINGTON_OUT_FOR_BLOOD:0 "Though not marcher lords by culture or tradition, the history of House Connington is not too unlike that of those along the Stoneway or Prince's Pass.

KENNING_LEGACY_OF_HERROCK_KENNING:0 "House Kenning of Kayce was founded in a peculiar way.

KENNING_BRUTAL_HISTORY:0 "Like all ironborn, House Kenning of Kayce's lineage have partaken in many particularly brutal excursions, serving in many raids. Unlike most ironborn however, these raids were in the name of the Kingdom of the Rock, not the captains, lords or kings of the Iron Isles.

KENNING_LOYAL_TO_THE_ROCK:0 "After forsaking their previous Ironborn overlords, House Kenning of Kayce has been wholly loyal to the kings, and now lords, of [GetTitleByKey('c_casterly_rock').GetNameNoTier], and no Kenning has yet forsaken these new vows.\n#weak Some Kennings tend to become [GetTrait('loyal').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]."

tarth_legacy_4_name: "Sapphire Shield of the Narrow Sea"
tarth_legacy_5_name: "Kings of Morne"

TARTH_FIRST_MEN_ORIGINS:0 "Tarth was the first region of House Durrandon's Kingdom of the Storm to be conquered during the Andal invasion. The Durrandon Storm Kings and their First Men bannermen eventually intermarried with the Andals, however. House Tarth, who rule the island from Evenfall Hall and were once kings, have Andal ancestry."
TARTH_LEGACY_OF_SER_GALLADON_OF_MORNE:0 "Ser Galladon is remembered as a perfect knight, whose valor was so great that The Maiden herself fell in love with him. She gave him an enchanted sword, the Just Maid, to demonstrate her love for him. No sword could check the sword's blows, and no shield could stop them. According to the legend, Galladon only unsheathed the sword three times, not once against a mortal man, for the fight would have been unfair. Galladon is said to have slain a dragon with the Just Maid." \n#weak Some Tarths tend to become [GetTrait('brave').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]
TARTH_MARVELOUS_MARBLE_OF_TARTH:0 "A spine of mountains with hidden valleys runs down the center of Tarth; within these valleys, marble is available for mining. Tarth is one of two places within Westeros that marble can be accessed. Marble from Tarth was used during the construction of the Eyrie in the Vale of Arryn."
TARTH_SAPPHIRE_SHIELD_OF_THE_NARROW_SEA:0 "Tarth is called the Sapphire Isle for the striking blue seas in which it sits. Some monarchs kept fleets along the western coast of Tarth, as its mountains shield against storms and make the Straits of Tarth more pacific than the narrow sea or Shipbreaker Bay."
TARTH_KINGS_OF_MORNE:0 "Ancestors of House Tarth were once kings, and the head of the family is known as the Evenstar, which they claim dates back to the Dawn of Days. The island of Tarth came under the dominion of Storm Kings of House Durrandon when Durran the Fair married the daughter of Tarth's king, Edwyn Evenstar. Now in ruins, Morne on the eastern coast of Tarth was once the seat of the petty kings who were conquered by Storm Kings. Maester Hubert believes the site was of Andal origin, not First Men."

MASSEY_FIRST_MEN_ORIGINS:0 "The Masseys are a house of First Men origin. Lord Maldon Massey, a vassal of the Storm King Durran the Ravenfriend, built Stonedance and ruled Massey's Hook. The Masseys broke away from House Durrandon during the reign of King Durwald the Fat, however. During the Age of the Hundred Kingdoms, petty kings from House Massey were one of many who historically claimed the mouth of the Blackwater Rush."
MASSEY_LEGACY_OF_TRISTON_MASSEY:0 "When Aegon the Conqueror prepared to begin his conquest of Westeros, he summoned his friends and bannermen to attend to him on Dragonstone, Lord Massey among them. Despite being sworn to House Durrandon of Storm's End, Triston had closer ties to House Targaryen. After Aegon was crowned as King of All Westeros, he created the first small council and Lord Triston had the honor of becoming the first Master of Laws. 
MASSEY_SERVING_THE_DRAGON:0 "Though never dragonriders themselves, House Massey has remained fiercely loyal to the Targaryens for centuries. \n#weak Members of House Massey tend to become [GetTrait('loyal').GetName( GetNullCharacter )].

While the Velaryons and Celtigars dominated the middle reaches of the Narrow Sea, the Massey fleets maintained superiority over the Gullet and the eastern end of the Blackwater Bay."
MASSEY_REVENGE_OF_MILK-EYE_MASSEY:0 "Justin Massey, known as Milk-Eye for his unsettling pale left eye, was a feared pirate-king who ruled the waters of Massey’s Hook during the Andal invasions. While most First Men lords resisted the newcomers, Justin carved out a maritime dominion, commanding a fleet of raiders who terrorized the Narrow Sea. His defiance made him an enemy of Erich VII Durrandon, the Storm King, who sought to bring Massey’s Hook under his rule. Though Massey’s Hook was eventually claimed, Justin’s name lived on in whispered tales among sailors, who swear his ship still prowls the waters, seeking vengeance. House Massey, though bound by duty to history’s tides, never forgot their rogue monarch—the man who ruled both land and sea, refusing to bow until the very end.

CORBRAY_ANDAL_ORIGINS:0 "The Corbrays were an Andal house during the coming of the Andals to Westeros. Corwyn Corbray conquered the Fingers by defeating Houses Brightstone and Shell, claiming for himself the title of Lord of the Five Fingers. When the First Men began to unite against the Andals, King Robar II Royce slew Qyle Corbray, King of the Fingers. The Corbrays claim that Ser Jaime Corbray killed Robar in the Battle of the Seven Stars."
CORBRAY_LEGACY_OF_GWAYNE_CORBRAY:0 "Ser Gwayne fought during the First Blackfyre Rebellion, at the Battle of the Redgrass Field in Lord Donnel Arryn's vanguard. Lord Arryn's lines were shattered and nearly overrun by Daemon I Blackfyre, until Ser Gwayne appeared with reinforcements. Ser Gwayne came across Daemon and the two dueled ahorsed for nearly an hour. The duel was considered a sight to behold, partly because of the clashing of two Valyrian steel swords against each other, with Gwayne wielding Lady Forlorn and Daemon with Blackfyre." \n#weak Members of House Corbray are much more likely to become [GetTrait('aspiring_blademaster').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]
CORBRAY_LOVE_FORLORN:0 "Lady Forlorn, the Corbrays' legendary Valyrian steel sword, has been the subject of bitter rivalries and bloodshed between kin. Many Corbray lords have fought over it, believing its wielder to be the true strength of the house. To hold Lady Forlorn is to carry the weight of history—and to be ready to kill for it."
CORBRAY_THE_FIVE_FINGERS_GRIP_TIGHT:0 "The Corbrays carved out a domain in the Fingers, securing their place among the nobility of the Vale. Though a harsh land, it breeds hardy warriors and disciplined commanders. Those who rule the Fingers know that fortresses must hold, and blades must be ready."
CORBRAY_OATHS_HELD_IN_STEEL:0 "The Corbrays have long been loyal vassals of House Arryn, standing beside the rulers of the Vale in war and peace.
