 vohn_travel_events.1000.t:0 "Winterfell: Arrival"
 vohn_travel_events.1000.desc:0 "Winterfell — seat of House [winterfell_lord.GetHouse.GetName] and heart of the North, standing proud and tall among the vastness of the North.\n\nAs I approach the castle from the kingsroad, I pass through the Wintertown, the spacious, and at the moment largely empty, settlement outside the walls. As I move further east, the walls come to dominate the skyline. The outer reaches eighty feet, and the inner reaching another twenty higher. They are dark and gray; the weathered stone speaks to the great age of the castle.\n\nThe East Gate stands open and welcoming, and inside you find the [winterfell_lord.GetFullName] waiting with salt and bread. After the bestowing of guest right, [winterfell_lord.GetSheHe] gives you leisure to explore the castle. "
 vohn_travel_events.1000.godswood:0 "I will explore the famed #bold godswood#!, home of the Old Gods."
 vohn_travel_events.1000.tombs:0 "I will explore the renowned #bold crypts#!, where history stands guard forever more."
 vohn_travel_events.1000.glass_gardens:0 "I will walk through the celebrated #bold glass gardens#!, the beating heart of the castle."
 vohn_travel_events.1000.wintertown:0 "Actually I would prefer to peruse the Wintertown and its more ... #italic carnal#! attractions."
 vohn_travel_events.1000.opt_out:0 "I don't have time to waste exploring."

 vohn_travel_events.1001.t:0 "Winterfell: Godswood"
 vohn_travel_events.1001.intro_old_gods:0 "Walking through the godswood, I cannot help but feel like I have returned home, the dark and primal beauty of the godswood calling to me in a mysterious way.\n\n"
 vohn_travel_events.1001.intro_other:0 "Walking through the godswood, I cannot help but feel like I am trespassing, and yet the dark and primal beauty of the godswood calls to me all the same.\n\n"
 vohn_travel_events.1001.desc:0 "Making my way through the trees, I find myself in front of a small clearing surrounding the hot springs with the great weirwood heart tree growing right next to them. Moving closer to the pool and tree, I feel compelled."
 vohn_travel_events.1001.a:0 "The #bold heart tree#!, the Old Gods themelves call to me."
 vohn_travel_events.1001.b:0 "The warmth and rejuvanation of the #bold hot springs#! cannot be denied."

 vohn_travel_events.1002.t:0 "Winterfell: Godswood"
 vohn_travel_events.1002.desc:0 "Kneeling before the heart tree, I feel at peace.\n\nI can hear every thing in the wood far clearer: the sound of the wind in the branches, the water on the rocks, the plodding of the animals in the wood, and through it all, #italic yes#!, the Old Gods, the #bold true#! gods, are speaking to me."
 vohn_travel_events.1002.a:0 "I feel born anew, a follower of [GetReligionByKey('old_gods_religion').GetName]."
 vohn_travel_events.1002.b:0 "I feel newly attuned to the [GetReligionByKey('old_gods_religion').GetName]."

 vohn_travel_events.1003.t:0 "Winterfell: Godswood"
 vohn_travel_events.1003.desc:0 "Laying in the pool, I feel all the stress and worry that has long plagued me wash away with the warm waters. In contrast to the brisk air above, the hot springs' embrace provides a comfort that I have not felt in years. I could float here for ages, though now that I have relaxed I must be about things again."
 vohn_travel_events.1003.a:0 "I feel a new sense of peace for the future."

 vohn_travel_events.1004.t:0 "Winterfell: Crypts"
 vohn_travel_events.1004.desc:0 "I make my way past the ancient First Keep, walking among the lichen-spotted headstones in the lichyard where the servants of the old Kings of Winter lie.\n\nBefore me stands an old ironwood door: the entrance to the labyrinthine crypts. Each step downward is marked by a new chill as I descend from the world of the living to the catacombs of the dead.\n\nWalking amid the crypts, I find the dark corridors a maze. The faint torchlight gives little guidance. As I come to an intersection, I must choose #bold right#! or #bold left#!."
 vohn_travel_events.1004.a:0 "I will head to the right, I think I see something down that way."
 vohn_travel_events.1004.b:0 "There is a torch to the left; that must be the way to go!"

 vohn_travel_events.1005.t:0 "Winterfell: Crypts"
 vohn_travel_events.1005.intro:0 "As I continue down the corridor, I find myself face to face with a statue of a man, a crowned king. To either side of his throne are stone direwolves, and upon his lap is a sword, long ago rusted. The few words etched upon the side are slightly worn away, but still decipherable:\n\n"
 vohn_travel_events.1005.jon:0 "#bold [stark_ancestor.GetFullNameNicknamed].#! I can't help but look upon the statue with more respect. Here is the King who drove out the raiders and slavers from the east and built the Wolf's Den, the ancient precursor of White Harbor. The man was fearsome warrior and a strong king."
 vohn_travel_events.1005.brandon:0 "#bold [stark_ancestor.GetFullNameNicknamed].#! I can't help but look upon the statue with more respect. This was the famed king who united with Joramun, King-Beyond-the-Wall, to bring an end to the Night's King and his Corpse Bride. Together, the two would defend the realms of men from the horrors that the Night's King would have surely wrought."
 vohn_travel_events.1005.theon:0 "#bold [stark_ancestor.GetFullNameNicknamed].#! I can't help but look upon the statue with more respect. The Hungry Wolf is famed even outside of the North, known for uniting the North before the coming of the Andals, and then defeating said invaders — and then attacking even Andalos itself in Essos. He battled anyone and everyone, from Andal to Ironmen, and more; he was a true lord of war."
 vohn_travel_events.1005.rodrik:0 "#bold [stark_ancestor.GetFullNameNicknamed].#! I can't help but look upon the statue with more respect. Rodrik Stark is sung of even to this day, especially when any troubles with the Ironmen arose. He is said to have won Bear Island from the squids in an arm wrestle and bestowed it upon House Mormont. "
 vohn_travel_events.1005.a:0 "The history here is palpable."

 vohn_travel_events.1006.t:0 "Winterfell: Crypts"
 vohn_travel_events.1006.desc:0 "Soon, a page finds me in the depths of the crypts and announces that dinner will soon be served. Thankfully, the page knows the way out and leads me once again to the surface."
 vohn_travel_events.1006.a:0 "I will not forget this day."

 vohn_travel_events.1007.t:0 "Winterfell: Crypts"
 vohn_travel_events.1007.desc:0 "I have clearly chosen the wrong way, for I now find myself even further lost in these corridors. The torches are randomly placed, only leading me further and further downward. #italic Each step deeper brings a further chill.#!\n\nI can feel a strange heat emanating from the walls and the ceiling, drawing me further into the depths. Coming around a corner, I see the last thing I would have expected to find in the crypts beneath Winterfell...\n\nBefore me is a #bold dragon egg#!! Placed in some sort of holder, it was clearly left here for a purpose, but what such a purpose could be, I cannot even begin to fathom. "
 vohn_travel_events.1007.a:0 "Surely its purpose is to remain in this place."
 vohn_travel_events.1007.b:0 "After all, why not? Why shouldn't I take it?"

 vohn_travel_events.1008.t:0 "Winterfell: Glass Gardens"
 vohn_travel_events.1008.desc:0 "Walking into the glass gardens, I suddenly feel overdressed. The furs and cloaks I have worn to combat the briskness of the castle now feel far too hot in these glass houses.\n\nAll around, copper pipes let out steam and hot air, which has been brought up from deep under the earth. Rows upon rows of vegetables and other foods are grown, even in the coldest days of winter. And as I move further to the back, I can see the famed #bold;color:{0.52,0.65,0.86} winter roses#!. Their pale blue petals are striking in appearance beyond any other rose I have ever seen."
 vohn_travel_events.1008.a:0 "I should study the engineering and see if it would be possible to replicate"
 vohn_travel_events.1008.b:0 "Mayhaps I could ask to take a bloom home..."
 vohn_travel_events.1008.c:0 "The glass gardens are truly a wonder to behold."
 vohn_travel_events_unlocked_glass_garden:0 "You unlock Glass Garden duchy building."

 vohn_travel_events.1009.t:0 "Winterfell: Wintertown"
 vohn_travel_events.1009.desc:0 "Leaving the ancient castle, I head into the Wintertown. Even though it is far from full, there are still many people milling about: Farmers displaying their crops, tradesmen hawking their wares, an occasional busker belting out a tune...\n\nMaking discrete inquiries, I soon find the place I was looking for: #bold Roses#!. The locals all assured me that I will have a good time, and with my coin purse I am sure I will."
 vohn_travel_events.1009.a:0 "Time to spend some coin..."
 vohn_travel_events.1009.b:0 "Maybe just a drink at the tavern instead..."
