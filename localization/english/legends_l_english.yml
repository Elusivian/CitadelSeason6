And so he spoke, and so he spoke, that lord of Castamere, But now the rains weep o'er his hall, with no one there to hear. Yes now the rains weep o’er his hall, and not a soul to hear.""

legend_tywin_lannister_conclusion: "As the story of House Reyne of Castamere is immortalized in song, so is the power of House Lannister. All those who would choose to defy House Lannister will face the consequences of their action as the lion has awoken."
