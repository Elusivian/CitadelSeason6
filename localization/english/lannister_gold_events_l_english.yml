 lannister_gold.0001.t:0 "The Golden Bank of Lannisport"
 lannister_gold.0001.desc:0 "The golden veins within the Rock are beginning to dwindle, and so the boundless wealth our house has long enjoyed could be at risk. But where one door closes, another opens. We have decided to establish the Golden Bank of Lannisport—a full-fledged banking institution that will secure our family's legacy and financial dominance across Westeros.\n\nOur experience with smaller loans and lending to the crown has laid the groundwork, but this new venture demands expertise beyond our current means. Lacking the financial know-how to launch such an enterprise ourselves, we have resolved to summon the best bankers from across the world to aid us. Of course, as highborn lords, we cannot be seen getting our hands dirty in the day-to-day dealings of the bank; lesser subordinates will be entrusted with its management."
 lannister_gold.0001.a:0 "Summon the greatest financial minds!"
 lannister_gold.0001.a_tt:0 "You call for aid to the greatest financiers across the land"
 
 lannister_gold.0002.t:0 "The Architects of Wealth"
 lannister_gold.0002.desc:0 "With the Golden Bank of Lannisport now established, the time has come to choose those who will guide it to greatness. The finest bankers and merchants from across the known world have arrived at your behest, eager to lend their expertise to this new endeavor. Three distinct groups present themselves, each offering a unique path for the future of the bank.\n\nThe first group hails from Braavos, led by a former member of the Iron Bank. They bring with them a wealth of experience in loan recovery and the ruthless efficiency that made the Iron Bank feared across the world. These seasoned bankers are ready to apply their hard-earned knowledge to ensure that every coin lent by the Golden Bank returns with interest.\n\nThe second group comprises skilled merchants from Lys, experts in handling debt and trade. They have learned from the rise and fall of the Rogare Bank and are determined to avoid the same pitfalls. Their leader, a shrewd trader with a keen eye for opportunity, promises to navigate the treacherous waters of commerce and ensure the bank’s prosperity.\n\nThe third option is to appoint local merchants and lenders from the Westerlands. With deep ties to the artisans and traders of Lannisport, their leader knows the city and its people like no other."
 lannister_gold.0002.a:0 "We will go for the ruthless Braavosi."
 lannister_gold.0002.a_tt:0 "You hire the Braavosi Bankers"

 lannister_gold.0003.t:0 "Gold and Scorn"
 lannister_gold.0003.desc:0 "Whispers echo through the halls of Casterly Rock, as the Golden Bank of Lannisport begins to cast a long shadow over your reputation. The smallfolk murmur, labeling you a mere merchant and usurer, their voices fueled by the discontent of the Faith. The establishment of a bank by a noble house is seen as an affront to the gods, and the High Septon himself is said to be personally outraged.\n\nEven the Iron Throne grows wary, closely monitoring your every move, suspicious of the power your house may be accumulating through this new venture. The foundation of the Golden Bank, intended to cement your legacy, now threatens to unravel the very fabric of your standing among peers, commoners, and the crown alike"
 lannister_gold.0003.a:0 "Purchasing a royal charter will silence the Throne's doubts."
 lannister_gold.0003.a_tt:0 "You purchase a charter from the Crown"

 ### BORROW FROM THE BURGUERS ###
 
 lannister_gold.0005.t:0 "Merchants Withdraw their support"
 lannister_gold.0005.desc:0 "The debt owed to the merchants has come due, but the coffers are empty. Unable to fulfill our obligations, the merchants have lost faith in our house and have withdrawn their support. Without their backing, our influence wanes, and the whispers of our financial troubles spread like wildfire. The trust once built on gold is now shattered, leaving us vulnerable and isolated. Until we repay our debts to them, the merchants will not offer us another loan."
 lannister_gold.0005.a:0 "We must endure the consequences until we can repay them."
 lannister_gold.0005.a_tt:0 "You failed to pay the merchants back in time and they have now withdrawn their support until we repay them."
 
 
 ### Iron Bank Threat ###
 
 lannister_gold.0004.t:0 "A Cold Wind from Braavos"
 lannister_gold.0004.desc:0 "A delegation from the Iron Bank of Braavos has arrived in Lannisport, their presence as imposing as the reputation they carry. The leader of the envoys, a stern-faced Braavosi clad in somber robes, delivers their message without a hint of hesitation.\n\nThe Iron Bank demands that the Golden Bank of Lannisport cease all operations immediately. They accuse you of overstepping into the domain of the world's most feared financial institution, and warn that refusal will bring dire consequences. The Iron Bank does not threaten idly; their reach is long, and their methods are unforgiving."
 lannister_gold.0004.a:0 "We have no choice; shut it down."
 lannister_gold.0004.a_tt:0 "The Iron Bank's power is too great to challenge directly. The Golden Bank must close its doors."
 lannister_gold.0004.b:0 "Perhaps we can negotiate a compromise."
 lannister_gold.0004.b_tt:0 "A well-timed compromise might avoid open conflict while keeping some interests intact."
 lannister_gold.0004.c:0 "We will not be threatened. Send them away!"
 lannister_gold.0004.c_tt:0 "Braavos may be far, but the shadow of their influence is long."
 
 
 
 lannister_gold.0006.t:0 "The Golden Bank Shutters Its Doors"
 lannister_gold.0006.desc:0 "With a heavy heart, you gather your most trusted advisors in the grand hall of Casterly Rock. The opulent surroundings only deepen the bitterness of your decision. You decree that the Golden Bank of Lannisport must be shut down immediately. Messengers are sent to Lannisport, where the bank’s vaults are sealed, its ledgers closed, and its clerks dismissed. The once-bustling halls of the Golden Bank fall silent, a stark reminder of the Iron Bank’s power. Though their wrath has been averted, the closure marks a bitter setback for your house’s ambitions."
 lannister_gold.0006.a:0 "It is done; the Golden Bank is no more."
 lannister_gold.0006.a_tt:0 "Sometimes, survival requires sacrifice."
 
 
 lannister_gold.0007.t:0 "A Dangerous Negotiation"
 lannister_gold.0007.desc:0 "Refusing to submit entirely to the Iron Bank’s demands, you opt for negotiation. You summon your finest diplomats and meet with the Braavosi envoys in the shadowy halls of Casterly Rock. Their leader, Xaro Qosori, listens in icy silence as you propose a compromise.\n\nYou suggest either a partnership, a special charter recognizing the Golden Bank’s place under their protection, or even a large single payment to satisfy their immediate concerns. The outcome of this negotiation will determine whether the Iron Bank becomes a partner, or a relentless adversary."
 lannister_gold.0007.a:0 "Offer a partnership with the Iron Bank."
 lannister_gold.0007.a_tt:0 "Shared power could prevent open conflict."
 lannister_gold.0007.b:0 "Make a large payment to buy peace."
 lannister_gold.0007.b_tt:0 "Gold could buy us time and get the braavosi off our backs."
 lannister_gold.0007.c:0 "I changed my mind, send them away!"
 lannister_gold.0007.c_tt:0 "Reaffirm your position as a lord and send the envoys away, standing firm in your decision."
 
 lannister_gold.0008.t:0 "A Pact Forged in Gold"
 lannister_gold.0008.desc:0 "Against all odds, the envoys of the Iron Bank of Braavos have agreed to your terms. After days of tense negotiations, a deal has been struck. They will allow the Golden Bank of Lannisport to continue its operations, acknowledging its presence in the Seven Kingdoms. In return, they will receive a substantial one-time payment and certain privileges in future banking ventures.\n\nThis agreement will keep the Braavosi bankers content for now, allowing the Golden Bank to flourish without fear of retribution. The ink is barely dry, but the future now seems promising and profitable."
 lannister_gold.0008.a:0 "We must remain vigilant, the Iron Bank is never truly a friend."
 lannister_gold.0008.a_tt:0 "We managed to secure peace with the Iron Bank for now, but must remain alert for future threats."
 
 lannister_gold.0009.t:0 "A Pact with Braavos"
 lannister_gold.0009.desc:0 "After much back-and-forth, the Iron Bank of Braavos has finally agreed to a partnership with the Golden Bank of Lannisport. In exchange for allowing our bank to operate freely, we are to pay the Iron Bank a fixed sum of gold every month.\n\nThough this arrangement feels more like a tribute than a partnership, it will keep the Braavosi bankers at bay, ensuring that their considerable influence remains a distant threat rather than a present danger. The envoys leave with satisfied smiles, and we are left to ponder the price of peace."
 lannister_gold.0009.a:0 "We can live with this for now, but we must stay vigilant."
 lannister_gold.0009.a_tt:0 "You accept to pay tribute to the Iron Bank for now in exchange for peace."
 
 lannister_gold.0010.t:0 "The Iron Bank's Wrath"
 lannister_gold.0010.desc:0 "The envoys from the Iron Bank of Braavos may have left our halls, but their threats linger. Now, we hear whispers of the Iron Bank's plans to bring down the Golden Bank of Lannisport. Braavosi agents have been seen speaking with our rivals, bribing merchants, and spreading rumors to discredit us.\n\nTheir aim is clear: to crush our ambitions and maintain their iron grip on the world of finance. We underestimated their resolve, and now they are moving against us with all the power and influence they command."
 lannister_gold.0010.a:0 "They're sponsoring a challenger to my title! War is inevitable!"
 lannister_gold.0010.b:0 "We will survive whatever they throw at us!"
 lannister_gold.0010.c:0 "We must endure and prevail!"
 
 lannister_gold.0011.t:0 "The Golden Bank Shuts its Doors"
 lannister_gold.0011.desc:0 "The murmurs of the Faith and whispers of the smallfolk have grown too loud to ignore. The Golden Bank of Lannisport, once a symbol of power and prosperity, has now become a source of scandal and sin. Many claim that a lord dabbling in banking is unbecoming, akin to the acts of merchants and usurers.\n\nWith each passing day, the High Septon’s disapproval grows, and the Iron Bank’s looming presence casts a long shadow over our ambitions. Perhaps it is time to listen to these voices and return to the nobler pursuits befitting our station. By closing the Golden Bank, we could restore our standing and cleanse our reputation in the eyes of the Faith and the realm."
 lannister_gold.0011.a:0 "Close the Golden Bank and uphold our noble traditions."
 lannister_gold.0011.a_tt:0 "Shut down the Golden Bank, abandoning the ways of merchants for the respect of the Faith and nobility."

 lannister_gold.0012.desc:0 "Lately, an uneasy presence seems to lurk in every shadow, eyes watching your every move. Whispers surround you like a fog, feeding your growing paranoia.\n\nIt’s the Iron Bank—it must be. Since the Golden Bank of Lannisport was founded, they’ve been silently watching, waiting for the right moment to strike. Every rustle of paper and creak of the door sets your heart racing, wondering if today is the day they act.\n\nThe Iron Bank of Braavos does not tolerate competition, and you can feel their gaze fixed upon you, cold and calculating."
 lannister_gold.0012.a:0 "Double the guard."

Clutched in his hand is a finely crafted Essosi dagger, its blade still unsheathed.\n\n"We caught him sneaking toward your chambers, my lord." the guard captain says. The thug, bruised and beaten, shudders as he kneels. "Please, have mercy! I was hired by a foreigner with a strange accent down at the port...” he confesses through bloodied lips. "Paid in gold to slit your throat while you slept." His eyes shift nervously, betraying the fear that grips him.\n\nThe Iron Bank of Braavos immediately comes to mind. Ever since you established the Golden Bank of Lannisport, their agents have been watching. Perhaps this was their first move. Could they have sent this thug to eliminate the competition?"
 lannister_gold.0015.a:0 "You will forever rot in the dungeons of the Rock!"
 lannister_gold.0015.a_tt:0 "You throw the assasin in the dungeons until you decide his fate."

 lannister_gold.0016.desc:0 "You are awakened abruptly in the dead of night, a cold shiver running down your spine. The darkness of your chamber is pierced by the faint gleam of a blade, catching the moonlight through the window.\n\nA shadowy figure looms over your bed, a dagger poised to strike. For a heartbeat, time seems to stand still. The assassin's eyes glint with deadly intent, and you can feel your own heartbeat thundering in your ears. Adrenaline surges through your veins, your mind racing.\n\nThere’s no time to call for help—the choice is yours: flee to save your life, or stand your ground and fight off this silent intruder."
 lannister_gold.0016.a:0 "This Cannot be it, I need to RUN!"

Just as you are about to ascend the grand staircase, one of your trusted courtiers steps out of the shadows and greets you with a warm smile.\n\nThen, without warning, the courtier’s hand moves faster than you can react. A gleaming dagger appears, and you feel the cold steel pierce your flesh, once, twice, then repeatedly.You try to speak, but no words come out. The pain overwhelms you, spreading like fire, but it’s the coldness that you notice most.\n\nBefore darkness takes over, you catch a glimpse of your attacker's eyes. They are empty, devoid of any recognition or remorse.\n\nAnd then, in your final moments, realization strikes. These eyes... they are not those of your courtier. It’s as if you are looking at a stranger, a faceless being who wears the guise of your trusted companion. Understanding washes over you in your last heartbeat.

Your blade arcs through the air, slicing through his arm. The dagger clatters to the floor.\n\nHe recoils, his face contorted in pain and shock, as he watches the blood spurt from his severed limb. As you raise your sword for the final blow, he collapses, clutching his wounded arm, and pleads for his life.\n\n"Mercy, my lord!" he cries out, his voice shaking. "I was only a tool, hired by a foreign man for a few gold coins. I met him down at the port—please, I didn’t want to do this!""

Once there, you are to lure your employer into believing you have succeeded and then eliminate him. Search his body for any clues about who else might be involved in this conspiracy. No guards will pursue you, but make no mistake—my eyes will follow your every move."\n\nYou slide a pouch containing ten gold coins across the table—double his initial payment.

As you scan the documents, you catch a glimpse of gratitude and possibly loyalty in his eyes. This once mere mercenary now sees you differently, perhaps even as a savior, his thankfulness hinting at newfound allegiance."

 lannister_gold.0078.t:0 "An Ambitious Proposal"
 lannister_gold.0078.desc:0 "A charismatic entrepreneur, with a twinkle of mischief in his eye, approaches the Golden Bank with a bold proposal. 'Lannisport is a city of wealth and indulgence,' he begins smoothly. 'But what it lacks is a proper pleasure house—a place where the finest Lyseni girls could entertain the most distinguished guests. With your backing, I can establish the most renowned establishment in all of Westeros, where lords and merchants alike will flock to spend their coin.'\n\nThe offer is tantalizing, promising high returns, but it comes with a certain moral risk. The choice is yours: invest in this venture or turn away from what could be a lucrative, albeit controversial, opportunity."
